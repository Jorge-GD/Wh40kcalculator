### Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**

```
feat(calculator): add sustained hits protocol
fix(ui): correct theme toggle button alignment
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(services): add unit tests for calculation service
```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/Angular Code

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Angular style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public methods
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Code Formatting

We use Prettier and ESLint for code formatting:

```bash
# Check for lint issues
npm run lint

# Auto-fix lint issues
npm run lint:fix

# Format code
npm run format
```

### Component Structure

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-feature',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, FormsModule],
  templateUrl: './feature.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./feature.component.scss'],
})
export class FeatureComponent implements OnInit {
  // Public properties first
  public title = 'Feature Title';

  // Private properties
  private readonly destroy$ = new Subject<void>();

  constructor(private readonly service: FeatureService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Initialization logic
  }

  // Public methods
  public onAction(): void {
    // Method implementation
  }

  // Private methods
  private calculateResult(): number {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

### SCSS/CSS Guidelines

- Use CSS custom properties for theming
- Follow BEM methodology for class naming
- Use semantic class names
- Keep specificity low
- Use mixins for repeated patterns

```scss
// Good
.calculator-panel {
  background-color: var(--color-panel-bg);

  &__header {
    padding: var(--spacing-md);
  }

  &__content {
    @include flex-column;
  }
}

// Avoid
.panel {
  background: #333;
}
```

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Write tests for all public methods
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
- Mock external dependencies

```typescript
describe('CalculationService', () => {
  let service: CalculationService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    TestBed.configureTestingModule({});
    service = TestBed.inject(CalculationService);
  });

  it('should calculate hit probability correctly for skill 3+', () => {
    // Arrange
    const skill = 3;
    const expected = 4 / 6;

    // Act
    const result = service.calculateHitProbability(skill);

    // Assert
    expect(result).toBeCloseTo(expected, 2);
  });
});
```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for 80%+ code coverage
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Test error conditions and boundary values

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:ci

# Run specific test file
ng test --include="**/calculator.service.spec.ts"
```

## Documentation Guidelines

### Code Documentation

- Document all public APIs
- Include examples in JSDoc comments
- Explain complex algorithms
- Document assumptions and limitations

````typescript
/**
 * Calculates the probability of successful hits for a given weapon profile.
 *
 * @param attacks - Number of attacks (supports dice notation like "2D6")
 * @param skill - Weapon skill value (2-6)
 * @param modifiers - Optional hit modifiers
 * @returns Hit probability as a decimal between 0 and 1
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const hitChance = calculateHits("4", 3, { reroll: 'ones' });
 * console.log(hitChance); // 0.722 (approximately)
 * ```
 */
public calculateHits(attacks: string, skill: number, modifiers?: HitModifiers): number {
  // Implementation
}
````
